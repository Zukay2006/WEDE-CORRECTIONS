#Changelog
## - 2025-11-15


### Added
- I finally managed to correctly add a changelog since it was missing for Part 1 and Part 2 of the assignement.

  ### Fixed
  - I fixed my navigation menu, now all my pages on the website are correctly linked to each other, an individual can now scroll through pages without struggling or the pages not linking to each other correctly.
 
  ### Changed
  - I changed my README document and added all the information that I think is required.
